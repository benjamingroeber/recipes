## 🍕 My Recipes

These are some of the recipes I'm regularly making at home.
I'm putting these down more for myself than anyone else, such that there may be very
short or incomplete instructions.

### General Tips & Infos

* For yeasted breads I usually mix liquids, yeast and sugar first, then add flour and
salt.
* When using a standmixer, I first mix for a few minutes on lowest speed until all flour
is hydrated, then for the remaining time ( usually about 5-8 minutes ) until the dough
has reached the desired consistency.

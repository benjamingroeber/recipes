# Wheat Tortillas ðŸ«“ðŸ¥™ðŸŒ®

## Ingredients
* 750g  farina 00 flour ( [Rieper 00 Yellow](https://www.rieper.com/de/haushaltsmehle/produkte/produkt-details.html?code=0015) )
* 325g  water
* 100g  olive oil
* 15g   salt
* 2 tsp baking powder

The resulting dough will suffice for 12 tortillas of about 24cm diameter.

## Preparation
Mix the dough thoroughly for about 8 minutes until its uniform.
Divide the dough into 12 balls of about 100g each and let them rest for 10 minutes.

Preheat a non-stick pan on medium-high heat and roll out the dough balls into thin
disks of about 24 cm. Cook the disks once from each side until bubbles appear. If you
got everything perfect, they will even puff up.

Take them out when they are still a little soft, such that they can be rolled easier afterwards.

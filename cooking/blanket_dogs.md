# Dogs in a Blanket ðŸŒ­

This is a delicious frankenstein mix between a _hot dog_ and _pigs in a blanket_.
This recipe serves about 6 persons as main dish, so feel free to adjust the ingredients as needed.

## Ingredients
* 6 Wiener WÃ¼rstchen, or any parboiled sausage you like

### Dough
* 675g farina 00 flour ( [Rieper 00 Yellow](https://www.rieper.com/de/haushaltsmehle/produkte/produkt-details.html?code=0015) )
* 270g tepid water
* 45g  melted butter
* 75g  sugar
* 15g  salt
* 1    large egg
* 1    block of fresh yeast (24g)

### Toppings
* 1 egg
* sesame seeds as required

## Preparation
Mix wet and dry ingredients for the dough. Mix for about 8-10 minutes, until nice and firm.
Let it rest for ~1-2 hours until the volume roughly doubles.

Divide the dough in 6 equal parts, elongate and shape them into 20-25 cm long strips.
Let them rest again for an hour or so.

## Baking
Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Right before baking, wrap the dough around your sausages and place
them on a baking sheet. Whip up the egg together with a teaspoon of water and brush the surface
of the dough a few times with the egg wash. At last, sprinkle on sesame seeds as desired.

Bake at 180Â°C for about 20 minutes until nicely browned.

### Bun Topping

## Preparation
Mix wet and dry ingredients for the dough. Mix for about 8-10 minutes, until nice and firm.
Let it rest for ~1-2 hours until the volume roughly doubles.

Divide the dough in 6 equal parts, shape them into tight balls, then flatten them to about 1-2 cm height and 
~ 8 cm diameter,and place them on a baking tray, lined with a baking sheet.
Let them rest there for another hour or so, covered by another inverted baking tray.

## Baking
Briefly before baking, uncover and mix the egg with the water, and brush the top of the buns with the egg wash.
Sprinkle on sesame seeds as desired and put them into the oven at 180¬∞C for 20 minutes, until lightly browned.

## Cooking
I like my patties simple, so I season the ground meat only with salt and pepper. During mixing, try to touch
it as little as possible, such that it doesn't melt into a meat paste. Then form round patties of about 100g
each, with a diameter slightly larger than your buns, as the patties will shrink during cooking.

Cut your buns in half horizontally and cook each patty for about 2-3 minutes for a medium-rare center.
After cooking, feel free to top off your hamburger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or
whatever topping you can imagine. Condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise will round off your dish.

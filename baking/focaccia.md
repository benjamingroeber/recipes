# Focaccia üçû
## Ingredients
### Dough
* 675g farina 00 flour ( [Rieper 00 Yellow](https://www.rieper.com/de/haushaltsmehle/produkte/produkt-details.html?code=0015) )
* 460g tepid water
* 35g  olive oil
* 25g  salt
* 20g  sugar
* 1    block of fresh yeast (24g)

Hydration: 74 %

### Toppings
* flaky salt
* rosemary
* halved cherry tomatoes

## Preparation
After mixing, place dough in a well oiled bowl. The dough will be very sticky, but don't add more flour!
Stretch and fold every 20-30 minutes for about 2-3 times. Then let it rest until the volume roughly
doubles ( ~1-2 hours ).

Cover a baking sheet completely with olive oil. Pour the dough into the baking sheet and gently stretch
it into a square form. Be gentle in order to preserve as much air in the dough as possible. Stop whenever
you feel the dough resisting and wait for a few minutes. This helps the gluten to relax and will avoid
tearing. When done, cover with an inverted baking sheet and let rest for another hour or two.

Right before baking halve your cherry tomatoes and garnish with flaky salt and rosemary as pleased.

## Baking
Bake at 180¬∞C for 35-40 minutes until golden brown.

## Ingredients
### Dough
* 675g farina 00 flour ( [Rieper 00 Yellow](https://www.rieper.com/de/haushaltsmehle/produkte/produkt-details.html?code=0015) )
* 470g tepid water
* 15g  olive oil
* 25g  salt
* 20g  sugar
* 1    block of fresh yeast (24g)

Hydration: 72 %

### Toppings
* flaky salt
* rosemary
* halved cherry tomatoes

## Preparation
After mixing, place dough in well oiled bowl. It will be very sticky, but don't add flour!!!
Stretch and fold every 20-30 minutes for about 2-3 times, then let it rest until the volume doubles
( ~1-2 hours ).

Pour dough into well oiled baking sheet and gently stretch into a square form. Stop whenever you feel
the dough resisting and wait for a few minutes. Be gentle in order to preserve as much air in the dough
as possible. When done, cover with an inverted baking sheet and let rest for another hour or two.

Right before baking halve your cherry tomatoes and garnish with flaky salt and rosemary as pleased.

## Baking
Bake at 180Â°C for 35-40 minutes until golden brown.

## Ingredients
* 400g 00 flour ( [Rieper 00 Yellow](https://www.rieper.com/de/haushaltsmehle/produkte/produkt-details.html?code=0015) )
* 350g full grain wheat flour ( [Rieper Full Grain Wheat Flour](https://www.rieper.com/de/haushaltsmehle/produkte/produkt-details.html?code=0053))
* 525g water
* 30g olive oil
* 25g salt
* 20g sugar
* 1   block of fresh yeast (24g)

### Stats
* Total flour weight = 750g
* Hydration: 74%

## Preparation
After mixing, leave the dough to rise, until about doubling the volume (~ 2hours).
For plate sized pizzas form balls of about 270g, shape them to tight balls and leave to rest for
another 1-2 hours.

## Baking
When shaping the dough, try to leave as much air as possible in the dough, by gently flattening it
and stretching from the border. Don't stretch from the center, as it easily gets too thing there!

Toppings go on, right before baking!

I usually bake for 5 minutes using an electric pizza oven for best results. ( [This one](https://www.g3ferrari.net/en/delizia-red-p399) )

If i bake in the oven, I usually do so at the highest possible temperature ( 260Â°C for me) for
about 10 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.

# (Semi-)Whole Grain Pizza 🍕
## Ingredients
* 400g 00 flour ( [Rieper 00 Yellow](https://www.rieper.com/de/haushaltsmehle/produkte/produkt-details.html?code=0015) )
* 350g whole grain wheat flour ( [Rieper Whole Grain Wheat Flour](https://www.rieper.com/de/haushaltsmehle/produkte/produkt-details.html?code=0053))
* 525g water
* 30g olive oil
* 25g salt
* 20g sugar
* 1   block of fresh yeast (24g)

Hydration: 74%

## Preparation
Combine wet and dry ingredients until all of the flour is well hydrated, then mix for 8 minutes until you get a
satisfying [windowpane](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=windowpane+test) result.
Otherwise mix 2 more minutes and repeat if necessary.

After mixing, leave the dough to rise in an big oiled bowl, until the volume roughly doubles (~2 hours).

For plate sized pizzas, portion the dough into 5 parts of about 270g (+/-10g) each and shape them into tight balls.

Leave to rest for another 1-2 hours. After 1 hour:

## Baking
When shaping the dough, try to leave as much air as possible in the dough, by gently flattening it and stretching from
the border.
Don't stretch from the center, as it easily gets too thin there!

Toppings go on, right before baking!

I usually bake for 5 minutes using an electric pizza oven for best results. ( [This one](https://www.g3ferrari.net/en/delizia-red-p399) )

If i bake in the oven, I usually do so at the highest possible temperature ( 260°C for me) for  about 10 minutes or
until the crust is golden brown.

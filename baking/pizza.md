## Preparation
Combine wet and dry ingredients until all of the flour is well hydrated, then mix for 8 minutes until
you get a satisfying window pane. Otherwise mix 2 more minutes and repeat if necessary.

After mixing, leave the dough to rise in an big oiled bowl, until the volume roughly doubles (~ 2hours).

For plate sized pizzas, portion the dough into partos of about 270g (+/-10g) and shape them to tight balls.

Leave to rest for another 1-2 hours. After 1 hour:

## Baking
When shaping the dough, try to leave as much air as possible in the dough, by gently flattening it
and stretching from the border. Don't stretch from the center, as it easily gets too thing there!

Toppings go on, right before baking!

I usually bake for 5 minutes using an electric pizza oven for best results. ( [This one](https://www.g3ferrari.net/en/delizia-red-p399) )

If i bake in the oven, I usually do so at the highest possible temperature ( 260Â°C for me) for
about 10 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.
